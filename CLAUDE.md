# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This appears to be a new, minimal repository for AI coding tools with only basic files (README.md and LICENSE). The repository structure suggests this is in early stages of development.

## Current State

- **Files**: Only README.md and LICENSE are present
- **Purpose**: "Try AI Coding" as stated in README.md
- **Language/Framework**: Not yet determined - no package.json, Cargo.toml, or other configuration files present

## Development Commands

Since this is a new repository with minimal structure, common development commands would need to be established based on the chosen technology stack. Check for package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, or similar configuration files to determine appropriate commands.

## Next Steps

1. Determine the technology stack (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
2. Set up basic project structure
3. Initialize package manager and dependencies
4. Create development scripts based on chosen framework

## Architecture

No established architecture yet - this is a blank slate for AI coding tools development.
